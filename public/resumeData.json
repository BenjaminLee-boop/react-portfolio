    "bio": "Bringing over two years of excellence in the software industry, I am a driven full-stack developer with expertise in various front-end and back-end languages. As a self-motivated professional, I love learning new techniques and experimenting with technologies such as React.js, MongoDB/MySQL, Node.js, Express, Redux, and Graph Ql. My technical acumen, paired with my interpersonal abilities, allows me to translate complex concepts, spearhead teams, and accomplish organisational targets. Owing to my intellectual curiosity, I strive to continuously learn more about software development. In addition to my profession as a full-stack developer, I enjoy photography, flying drones, and riding motorbikes. Photography has been a huge part of my life growing up, which is why I love picking up my camera and capturing all the moments that make life unique. As a passionate individual, I strive to better myself as a developer by constantly learning more about the ever-evolving world of technology.",
